## English Writing Assignment 1

This summer was all about swimming and relaxing. I didn’t go anywhere exciting, but I spent a lot of time swimming. It was the best way to cool off and also something that I never got bored with.

Sometimes I would swim for hours, going back and forth or just floating around without thinking about much. Other times, I would dive under the water or sit at the edge with my feet in. It was quiet and peaceful under the water, and it made the time go by faster. It felt like everything slowed down once I was underwater.

The rest of the time, I was usually drying off, taking a nap, or just hanging around. There wasn’t really a schedule, which made it even better. I could swim whenever I wanted and stop whenever I got tired. It didn’t feel like something I had to do, but something that simply made the day better.

By the end of the summer, I realized that I spent more time swimming than anything else. It wasn’t an exciting or busy vacation, but it was fun and relaxing. Swimming made the summer enjoyable, and that was enough for me.
